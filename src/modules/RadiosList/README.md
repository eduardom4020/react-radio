# RadiosList
>This module is a compoent in wich all the application run. It joins toolbar, radio itens and footer to make the entire application work. It has a 'global state' of the application and completes the click interaction by sending information to footer and the other itens.


In data folder we have a data source of the radios that is imported by this component and rendered to the user. This separation makes easy to create new radios, just by manipulating a json file.
